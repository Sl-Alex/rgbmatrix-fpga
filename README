This project is based on rgbmatrix-fpga project from DuinoPilot.
Original project aims to work with RGB LED matrices with simple LED driver chips,
however some matrices have a bit more complex drivers, which can control brightness
or other parameters. It could be very useful, but requires some additional
initialization steps. This fork works with FM6126A chips only, other HW may
require different configuration.

Features implemented:
* Control panel (both data and configuration) over SPI.
* Configurable linearization curve using extended "OE" control
* Panel configuration is sent after each frame
* Desktop streaming
* Test pattern (outputs red, green and blue gradients to the panel)
* User-defined images output

What's included:
* vhdl            VHDL source code for the design to use on the FPGA
  * testbenches   VHDL to use for simulation of selected entities
* test            Python test scripts
* docs            FM6126A documentation, project documentation.

README of the original project you can find in README.original
